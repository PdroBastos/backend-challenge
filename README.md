# Nodejs Challenge

  Hey, thanks for your interest in working with us. Before we continue your application we need to check if you can handle some skilss.
  We know that's boring and it sucks, but it allow us to create a team that really can collaborate. 
  
  So if you are here, we need to check some of your skills ok? Let's do It!

# What are we looking for?

First, we need you to know that you have a domain of Javascript and Nodejs. It's important to remember that our entire culture is based on Clean Code, so, be aware that we will expect that your code is well written and well documented, ok?
  
   You must use Nodejs 12+ for this challenge. You are not allowed to use Nextjs as framework. 
   
   - ** Database **
    You must use MongoDb or Postgres (Postgres is better) with some ORM.
    
   - ** Docker - Not Required **
     It would be great if you use Docker and Docker Compose for running your application. 
     Docker compose should contain the build of the application and the DB.
     
   - **Tests **
      You must implement some tests in your application. Those tests should run when the command npm test is prompted. We recommend you to use jest. (Be free to use whatever you like).
